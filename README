## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker**: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- **Docker Compose**: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>
```

---

### 2. Build the Docker Containers

Run the following command to build the Docker containers. This will download all necessary images and set up your environment with the required dependencies (~5-10 min):

```
bash
docker-compose build
```

---

### 3. Start the Application

Once the build is complete, start the application with:

```
bash
docker-compose up
```

This will:

- Start a container for the Node.js app.
- Start a MySQL container.
- Set up a containerized Python environment with all dependencies installed.

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

### 4. Verify the Setup

- **Node.js Application**: Verify itâ€™s running by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
- **MySQL Database**: Connect to the database via a MySQL client at `localhost:3306`.

---

### 5. Develop

You can now start developing the application. Any changes made to the code in the repository will be reflected in real-time in your containers.

---

### 6. Stopping the Application

To stop the application, run:

```
bash
ctrl+C
docker-compose down
```

This stops the containers and removes them, but preserves your data in the database.
