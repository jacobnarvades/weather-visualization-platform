Natural disasters and extreme weather events pose significant challenges to communities worldwide,


often leaving individuals unprepared and disconnected during critical moments. Building tools to address


these challenges can help save lives, foster resilience, and streamline recovery efforts. Whether it's


hurricanes, wildfires, tornados, or floods, each type of disaster presents unique problems that require


tailored solutions. Communities need tools to access real-time information, communicate effectively, and


coordinate resources to ensure preparedness and recovery. By leveraging modern technology and


community-driven design, we can create solutions that empower individuals and strengthen their ability to


respond to these crises.


For this project, your task is to design and develop a web application that aids a specific community in


preparing for, responding to, and recovering from natural disasters. The app should provide real-time


alerts, preparedness tools, and collaborative features. You may also incorporate additional features such as


interactive maps or volunteer coordination. Focus on creating a tool that is user-friendly, accessible, and


designed to meet the specific needs of the community you're addressing.


While this system is not required to be developed to be accessed via the web, it must be able to


be run on multiple different machines while accessing a central database (you may run a database


locally for testing and development, but it should function as if you were connecting to a


database on a central server).


Course Specifications:


●
Implements user authentication


●
Implements a dynamic database of user and item data


●
Implements one or more “operations” involving some form of frontend-backend-database


communication


Course Expectations:


●
Databases may use any existing dataset or have dummy data. Databases using datasets


should have at least 100 items. There can be exceptions based on the specific project.


●
New User creation/registration should be available


●
UI design should contain elements commonly found or expected such as a user profile,


login, logout.


●
Consideration for design aesthetics


●
System should be dynamic and responsive
